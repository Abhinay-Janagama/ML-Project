# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This project was developed as part of the **Tech Xelarate University Hackathon**, where we demonstrated the application of deep learning in medical diagnosis, achieving high accuracy in classification tasks.

## ü©∫ Project Overview:
Pneumonia is a potentially serious lung infection that requires timely diagnosis. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, this project automates the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray scans, providing an assistive diagnostic tool for medical professionals.

## üöÄ Features:
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Binary classification: **Pneumonia** vs. **Normal**
- Achieved high accuracy on validation and test sets
- Visualization of training metrics (loss & accuracy curves)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## üìÅ Dataset:
We used the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
